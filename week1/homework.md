# Design a blockchain

1) What behaviour do you want to promote?

   - [ ] Encourage nodes to participate - number of nodes increase security, block mining speed
   - [ ] Positive contributions to development if the chain - e.g. EIPs, on chain voting of improvements
   - [ ] Inclusiveness - open participation
   - [ ] Transactions occur quickly
   - [ ] Nodes act “honestly”
   - [ ] Immutability - Transactions cannot be reversed
   - [ ] Avoid double spend

2) What behaviour do you want to sanction?

   - [ ] Nodes introducing falsified transactions
   - [ ] Exploitation of bugs
   - [ ] Scam projects - never delivering on promises.

3) How would you incentivise behaviour?

   - [ ] Reward the mining of blocks with tokens
   - [ ] Remove tokens from dishonest validators
